## What is this?

This is a next.js app, hooked up to a Django REST framework API.

## What does it do?

You can enter a location name, minimum customers, maximum customers and average customers per day to the form and see sales numbers generated on a table.

It's backed up with an API to store this information, but utilizes CRUD so you can delete a previously entered location.

## How do I get this on my machine?

Feel free to fork or clone this repo.

From there copy and in your terminal:
```git clone 'url here'```

Now use your favorite code editor to make any changes or run the progam on your local host with:
```npm run dev```

Current version: 1.0
